This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, and the dimensions are not yet available when the component mounts.  This often happens when the component tries to access `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` before the native modules have fully initialized.  This results in `undefined` being returned for width and height, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes when attempting calculations or layouts.
